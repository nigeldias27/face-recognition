# Face Recognition
Created a graphical application to allow developers who are in the middle of a large project, 
seamlessly add face recognition to their project without having to go deep into the technical aspect. 
They simply have to add the userâ€™s faces, play around with some image processing values to attain the 
best face recognition model for their program. They can integrate face recognition into their application 
easily by just one line with the help of the library that I have created (named recognize).
